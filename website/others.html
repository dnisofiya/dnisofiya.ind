      <p><font face="Calibri">While doing this website, I figure out that it is very challenging. I'm facing a hard time on how to arrange the coding accurately so that the code will work. Besides, I also have to do a lot of research regarding the code to ensure that I'm using the right one. There are many version of them and tutorial on Youtube. However, not everything works for me. Therefore, I need to keep trying until the website run perfectly.<br> After that, I also use a lot of tools to ensure the images and videos that I put on the website is interesting. For example, Canva and Capcut. This to ensure that the images fit nicely in the website. I also use colour that is soft so that when they look at my website, it did not hurt their eyes.<br> Next, I also ask for help from my brother regarding this website. Since his major is computer science, he give me some tips on how to make the website more appealing. I applied some of his tips in the website to make it more easier for me.</p>
