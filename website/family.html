    <td>My family consists of six people: me, my mother and father, and three of my brothers. Despite being the only daughter, I never feel like I'm missing out on anything simply because I don't have an older sister.<br>So, my father is Mohd Foad bin Md Shah. His works are related to business. He is an excellent cook, and the tastiest rendang daging I have ever eaten was made by him. Next, my mother. Her name is Norizan binti Saed. She works as a nurse at Taiping Hospital. Although she was busy, she always made an effort to spend time with us.<br>
    Moving on to my brothers. The first son is named Abid Afham and the other two is my little brother called, Afiq Fahim and Adam Asyraf. I also have three cats named Jerry, Senku and Yummy.&#x1F606;</td>
